# JavaLand


We are committed to promoting the digitization of the world of libraries, facilitating their management and making reading and knowledge as accessible as possible.
------------------------------------------------------------------
For librarians and library users who need a better way to manage their book loggings, the JavaLand is an interactive library management system that allows librarians to manage book details, reader details and borrowings and library users to track their borrowings status. Unlike most libraries' systems, our product allows the user to directly borrow the book, lets the users know in advance which resources are available and also allows the librarians to keep a close track of what books are being borrowed, update right away new information about new titles and guarantee that the borrowing periods are respected.

This project is divided in 2 applications: Admin (Desktop Version) and User (Android Version)
